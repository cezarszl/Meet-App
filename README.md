# Meet App

Meet is a versatile events app that allows users to filter, explore, and visualize events effortlessly. Whether you're looking for local meetups or exploring events in different cities, Meet has you covered.

## Features and user stories

1. **Filter Events by City**
   * As a user, I want to be able to choose a specific city so that I can find events happening in that location.
   * Given I am on the events page, when I select a city from the filter options, then the displayed events should be limited to those in the selected city.

2. **Show/Hide Event Details**
   * As a user, I want the ability to see more or less information about an event without navigating away from the event list.
   * Given I am viewing a list of events, when I click on a specific event, then the event details should either be shown or hidden based on the current state.

3. **Specify Number of Events**
   * As a user, I want to control the number of events displayed on the screen to suit my preferences.*
   * Given I am on the events page, when I specify the number of events I want to see (e.g., 5, 10, 20), then the system should update the event list accordingly.

4. **Use the App When Offline**
   * As a user, I want to be able to access previously loaded event data even when I'm not connected to the internet.
   * Given I have used the app and loaded event data, when I lose internet connectivity, then the app should still allow me to view the previously loaded event data.

5. **Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen**
   * As a user, I want a quick and convenient way to access the Meet app.
   * Given I have installed the app on my device, when I select the option to add a shortcut to the home screen, then a shortcut icon for the app should be added for easy access.

6. **Display Charts Visualizing Event Details**
   * As a user, I want to visually understand event details through charts for a more engaging experience.
   * Given I am on the events page, when I choose to view charts, then the app should display visual charts providing insights into event details, such as attendance numbers or event categories.
